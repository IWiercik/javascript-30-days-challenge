# Javascript 30 days challenge
### Hello there ! ðŸ˜ƒ
Javascript 30 days challenge is course created by Wes BOS(https://wesbos.com/).In this course the author encourages us, to create "with him" 30 projects,which will increase our knowledge of front end tools such as Javascript.
## My Approach
I was not making the projects identical as author,in some examples  I have added some extra things from me such as ðŸ•’ clock svg image (2nd project: https://iwiercik.github.io/javascript-30-days-challenge/2-day-clock-app/index.html)
## How to look on my projects
